### notes

check the sauce (this is just some css)  
if you're already using something like <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en' target='_blank'>Stylebot</a>, you can copy+paste the <a href='https://github.com/rickycodes/github-daybreak/blob/master/style.css'>css</a> there  
left a content.js for posterity... js one-liner is nice, but it blips!  
i might have missed a thing, if so open an <a href='https://github.com/rickycodes/github-daybreak/issues' target='_blank'>issue</a>  
pull requests welcomed!  
this might be configurable from github, but I can't see where? :eyes:  
probably works in other browsers?
